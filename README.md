# AWSGoogleCloudClone
Setup your own AWS/Google Cloud server and deploy your instances in PHP

I won't go into details of creating a login & register PHP script and will jump straight into the good details. The idea is to deploy a VM instance that would give our client access to the VPS server so that they have full access to their deployed instance. It's actually very easy in this demo I will be demonstrating this in Oracle's VM VirtualBox as it's my favorite application.

You can view the deploy.php for more information & it's very straight forward and easy to do.
